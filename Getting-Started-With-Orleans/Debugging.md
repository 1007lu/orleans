An Orleans-based application can be easily debugged during development but simply attaching debugger to the silo host process, such as a host crteated with the Orleans Dev/Test Host project template, OrleansHost.exe, Azure Compute Emulator or any other host process.
In production, it is rearly a good idea to stop a silo at a breakpoint because the frozen silo will soon get voted dead by the cluster membership protocol and will not be able to communicate with other silos in the cluster.
Hence, in productions tracing is the primary 'debugging' mechanism.

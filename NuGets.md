### Orleans NuGet packages as of [v1.0.9](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.0.9)

There are 4 key NuGet packages you will need to use in most scenarios:

Package   | Purpose
------------- | -------------
[Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Interfaces](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Interfaces/) | Build support for grain interfaces projects. Add it to your grain interfaces project to enable code generation for grain interfaces.
[<br>Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Grains](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Grains/) | Build support for grain implementation projects. Add it to your grain implementation project to enable code generation for grain classes.
[Microsoft.Orleans.Core](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Orleans.Core/) | Contains Orleans.dll, which defines most of Orleans public types and Orleans Client. Reference it for building libraries and client applications that use Orleans types but don't need any of the included providers.
[Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansRuntime](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansRuntime/) | Contains the silo runtime. Reference it to host a silo within your process.

If you don't care about fine granularity of the NuGet packages, the Client and Server packages include everything you may (or may not) need on the client or server side.

Package   | Purpose
------------- | -------------

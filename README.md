Orleans - Distributed Actor Model
=======

[![Build status](http://corefx-ci.cloudapp.net/jenkins/job/dotnet_orleans/badge/icon)](http://corefx-ci.cloudapp.net/jenkins/job/dotnet_orleans/)

Orleans is a framework that provides a straight-forward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns. 
It was created by [Microsoft Research][MSR-ProjectOrleans] and designed for use in the cloud. 
Orleans has been used extensively running in Microsoft Azure by several Microsoft product groups, most notably by 343 Industries as a platform for all of Halo 4 cloud services, as well as by a number of other projects and companies.

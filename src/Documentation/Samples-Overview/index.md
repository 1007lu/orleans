# Samples Overview

## What do I need?

To productively use the Orleans samples, please follow the [Prerequisites](../Getting-Started-With-Orleans/Prerequisites.md) section for the supported versions of the .NET framework, Visual Studio and Azure SDK.
An Azure subscription will help with some of the samples, but is not required. For the Azure-based samples, you will need to install the SDK.

The samples themselves can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/Samples).


## [Hello World](Hello-World.md)

This is the Orleans version of an old classic. It demonstrates that while there is no such thing as "trivial" when you are dealing with distributed computing, Orleans makes it pretty straight-forward.

## [Adventure](Adventure.md)

Before there was graphical user interfaces, before the era of game consoles and massive-multiplayer games, there were VT100 terminals and there was [Colossal Cave Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure). Possibly lame by today's standards, back then it was a magical world of monsters, chirping birds, and things you could pick up. It's the inspiration for this sample.
